# cPlusPlus_DS

This repository contains C++ programs from a textbook along with others I have created to keep my skills sharp.
The README will include a list of all of the programs with a short description of what they include/do.

1. throttle1
    - this program contains a class that emulates a throttle. It has 7 positions (0-6). The position can be changed and shut off.

2. throttle2
    - A rewrite of throttle1. I rewrote the program with the proper structure. It now containts a throttle.h (header file), and a throttle.cpp(implementation file). I also created the namespace 'natCom' to use with my future C++ programs.

3. circleLocation
    - circleLocation tracks a point on a circle's edge using angles (degrees). The directory includes the header file, implementation file, and a small test file.

4. point
    - point is a class that can create a point object with an x and y coordinate. It contains functions that can manipulate the points location, as well as operator overload functions for point addition and equality testing.
