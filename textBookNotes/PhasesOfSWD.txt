Data Structure - collection of organized data 

Phases of Software Development:
    - Specification of the task
    - Design of a solution
    - Implementation of the solution
    - Analysis of the solution
    - Testing and debugging
    - Maintenance and evolution of the system
    - Obsoloscence

C++
    - Designed by Bjarne Stroustrup (AT&T Bell Laboratories)
    - Extension of C 
    - Supports OOP (Object Oriented Programming)
        - technique that encourages important strategies of information hiding
          and component reuse.

Specification, Design, Implementation:
    - Specification: a precise description of the problem
    - Design: formulating the steps to solve the problem
    - Implementation: code to carry out the Design
    - Algorithm: set of instructions to solve a problem
    - Pseudocode: mixture of English and code 

Decomposing the problem
    - break down the problem into a few subtasks, decompose each subtask into smaller subtasks, and so forth.
    
- Preconditions and Postconditions
    - Preconditions: statement giving the condition that is required to be true when a function is called.
      The function is not guaranteed to perform as it should unless the precondition is true
    - Postcondition: statement describing what will be true when a function call is completed. If the function
      is correct and the precondition was true when the function was called, then the function will complete, 
      then the function will complete, and the postcondition will be true when the function call is completed
    - Example: 
        double celsius_to_fahrenheit(double c); // <-- prototype
        // Precondition: c is a Celsius temperature no less than absolute zero (-273.15)
        // Postcondition: The return value is the temerature c converted to Fahrenheit degrees

- Procedural Abstraction
    - simplifies your reasoning by abstracting away irrelevant details

- Function prototype
    - consists of a function's return type, name, and parameter list, all followed by a semicolon.
